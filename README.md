This is my implementation of some of the popular algorithms using javascript.
I'm going to implement the algorithms in two different ways, iteratively and recursive.

I have completed the algorithms:

Linear Search - both iteratively and recursive

Binary Search - both iteratively and recursive


I have not completed:

Merge Sort

Selection Sort

Breadth First Search
